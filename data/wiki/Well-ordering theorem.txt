In mathematics, the well-ordering theorem, also known as Zermelo's theorem, states that every set can be well-ordered. A set X is well-ordered by a strict total order if every non-empty subset of X has a least element under the ordering. The well-ordering theorem together with Zorn's lemma are the most important mathematical statements that are equivalent to the axiom of choice (often called AC, see also Axiom of choice § Equivalents). Ernst Zermelo introduced the axiom of choice as an "unobjectionable logical principle" to prove the well-ordering theorem. One can conclude from the well-ordering theorem that every set is susceptible to transfinite induction, which is considered by mathematicians to be a powerful technique. One famous consequence of the theorem is the Banach–Tarski paradox.


== History ==
Georg Cantor considered the well-ordering theorem to be a "fundamental principle of thought".  However, it is considered difficult or even impossible to visualize a well-ordering of 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
  
, the set of all real numbers; such a visualization would have to incorporate the axiom of choice. In 1904, Gyula Kőnig claimed to have proven that such a well-ordering cannot exist.  A few weeks later, Felix Hausdorff found a mistake in the proof.  It turned out, though, that in first-order logic the well-ordering theorem is equivalent to the axiom of choice, in the sense that the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms with the axiom of choice included are sufficient to prove the well-ordering theorem, and conversely, the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms without the axiom of choice but with the well-ordering theorem included are sufficient to prove the axiom of choice. (The same applies to Zorn's lemma.) In second-order logic, however, the well-ordering theorem is strictly stronger than the axiom of choice: from the well-ordering theorem one may deduce the axiom of choice, but from the axiom of choice one cannot deduce the well-ordering theorem.

There is a well-known joke about the three statements, and their relative amenability to intuition:The axiom of choice is obviously true, the well-ordering principle obviously false, and who can tell about Zorn's lemma?


== Proof from axiom of choice ==
The well-ordering theorem follows from the axiom of choice as follows.Let the set we are trying to well-order be 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  
, and let 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  
 be a choice function for the family of non-empty subsets of 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  
. For every ordinal 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  
, define an element 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            α
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{\alpha }}
  
 that is in 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  
 by setting 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            α
          
        
         
        =
         
        f
        (
        A
        ∖
        {
        
          a
          
            ξ
          
        
        ∣
        ξ
        <
        α
        }
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{\alpha }\ =\ f(A\smallsetminus \{a_{\xi }\mid \xi <\alpha \})}
  
 if this complement 
  
    
      
        A
        ∖
        {
        
          a
          
            ξ
          
        
        ∣
        ξ
        <
        α
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\smallsetminus \{a_{\xi }\mid \xi <\alpha \}}

          a
          
            α
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{\alpha }}
  
 undefined if it is. That is, 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            α
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{\alpha }}
  
 is chosen from the set of elements of 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  
 that have not yet been assigned a place in the ordering (or undefined if the entirety of 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  
 has been successfully enumerated). Then the order 
  
    
      
        <
      
    
    {\displaystyle <}
  
 on 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  
 defined by 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            α

          a
          
            β
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{\alpha }<a_{\beta }}
  
 if and only if 
  
    
      
        α
        <
        β
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha <\beta }
  
 (in the usual well-order of the ordinals) is a well-order of 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  
 as desired, of order type 
  
    
      
        sup
        {
        α
        ∣
        
          a
          
            α
          
        
        
           is defined
        
        }
        +
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sup\{\alpha \mid a_{\alpha }{\text{ is defined}}\}+1}
  
.


== Proof of axiom of choice ==
The axiom of choice can be proven from the well-ordering theorem as follows.

To make a choice function for a collection of non-empty sets, 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
  
, take the union of the sets in 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
  
 and call it 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
. There exists a well-ordering of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
; let 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
  
 be such an ordering. The function that to each set 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
  
 of 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
  
 associates the smallest element of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
  
, as ordered by (the restriction to 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
  
 of) 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
  
, is a choice function for the collection 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
  
.
An essential point of this proof is that it involves only a single arbitrary choice, that of 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
  
; applying the well-ordering theorem to each member 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
  
 of 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
  
 separately would not work, since the theorem only asserts the existence of a well-ordering, and choosing for each 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
  
 a well-ordering would require just as many choices as simply choosing an element from each 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
  
. Particularly, if 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
  
 contains uncountably many sets, making all uncountably many choices is not allowed under the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice.
