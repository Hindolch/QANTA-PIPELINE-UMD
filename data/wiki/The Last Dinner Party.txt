== History ==


=== 2018–2022: Formation and early years ===
Morris (from London), Davies (from Australia) and Mayland (from Hebden Bridge) met in 2018 during Freshers' Week at King's College London and decided to form a band after frequently attending gigs together at The Windmill and feeling inspired by being part of the scene around the venue with bands such as Black Midi and HMLTD. Their original name, the Dinner Party, was "inspired by the idea of a huge debauched dinner party where people came together to celebrate with a hedonistic banquet". Emily Roberts was recommended to Morris as a guitarist by a mutual friend and Nishevci was brought in. Roberts and Nishevci attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.

The band initially struggled to find time to rehearse together because of the COVID-19 lockdown in the UK, and they did not perform live until their first gig at The George in London in November 2021. They signed with management group Q Prime in early 2022. They spent the following year honing their sound and building word-of-mouth support on the live circuit in London, including playing a set as the opening act (while still called The Dinner Party) for the Rolling Stones in Hyde Park in July 2022, and supported Benee on her world tour for the London show.


=== 2023–2024: Signing to Island Records and Prelude to Ecstasy ===
After signing with Island Records as the Last Dinner Party, to avoid confusion with the jazz supergroup Dinner Party, they released their debut single "Nothing Matters", produced by James Ford, on 19 April 2023. The song was later used as part of the soundtrack for EA Sports FC 24. During the summer of 2023 the band supported Hozier and played festivals in the UK, Ireland and Europe, including Glastonbury and Latitude. They were also invited to play a live session on the BBC Radio 6 Music show, New Music Fix Friday. The band opened for First Aid Kit on three of their UK dates in August 2023, including Liverpool.
After releasing two more Ford-produced singles, "Sinner" and "My Lady of Mercy", they made their first appearance on the BBC show Later... with Jools Holland on 21 October 2023 performing "Nothing Matters" and "My Lady of Mercy". On 1 November, the band officially announced their debut album Prelude to Ecstasy with the release date of 2 February 2024 and another single "On Your Side", followed later by "Caesar on a TV Screen" in January.
In January 2024, they performed on the BBC's The Graham Norton Show. They were the winners of the BRITs Rising Star award at the Brit Awards 2024. In August 2024 the group announced the release Prelude to Ecstasy: Acoustics and Covers on 11 October. It featured the entire Prelude to Ecstasy studio album, with the addition of five live and acoustic versions of songs from the studio album and four cover songs performed in the studio and live. The first single for the expanded album, a cover of the Sparks song "This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us", was released on 28 August 2024. On 9 May 2025, Lizzie Mayland released their debut solo EP, The Slow Fire of Sleep, under the name L Mayland.


=== 2025–present: From the Pyre ===
On 17 July 2025 the group revealed "This Is the Killer Speaking", the lead single from their second studio album From the Pyre, which was scheduled to be released on 17 October. The song had previously debuted live in June 2024 at the Metronome Festival in Prague. They had initially begun to work on the album with James Ford, who produced Prelude to Ecstasy, but Ford decided to leave upon his diagnosis with leukaemia the following year. By August, Markus Dravs had replaced him to produce. The album was also preceded by two more singles, "The Scythe" and "Second Best".
On 23 August 2025, the Last Dinner Party were due to play Victorious Festival. They pulled out after an incident the previous day in which Irish folk band the Mary Wallopers had their set cut off after they brought out a Palestinian flag. In a statement on Instagram, the band wrote: "As a band we cannot cosign political censorship and will therefore be boycotting the festival today."


== Musical style ==
"Nothing Matters" was described as "art-rock bombast" by Rolling Stone UK, while the Evening Standard described their music and live shows as having a "distinctive baroque-pop sound and look". The band have been compared to David Bowie, Fleetwood Mac, Kate Bush, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Sparks, Roxy Music, ABBA, Queen, Florence and the Machine and Warpaint. The band's members have cited Queen, St. Vincent, Chappell Roan and Lana Del Rey as influences.
