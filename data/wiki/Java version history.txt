The Java language has undergone several changes since JDK 1.0 as well as numerous additions of classes and packages to the standard library. Since J2SE 1.4, the evolution of the Java language has been governed by the Java Community Process (JCP), which uses Java Specification Requests (JSRs) to propose and specify additions and changes to the Java platform. The language is specified by the Java Language Specification (JLS); changes to the JLS are managed under JSR 901. In September 2017, Mark Reinhold, chief architect of the Java Platform, proposed to change the release train to "one feature release every six months" rather than the then-current two-year schedule. This proposal took effect for all following versions, and is still the current release schedule.
In addition to the language changes, other changes have been made to the Java Class Library over the years, which has grown from a few hundred classes in JDK 1.0 to over three thousand in J2SE 5. Entire new APIs, such as Swing and Java2D, have been introduced, and many of the original JDK 1.0 classes and methods have been deprecated, and very few APIs have been removed (at least one, for threading, in Java 22). Some programs allow the conversion of Java programs from one version of the Java platform to an older one (for example Java 5.0 backported to 1.4) (see Java backporting tools).
Regarding Oracle's Java SE support roadmap, Java SE 25 (LTS) is the latest version as of September 2025, while versions 21, 17, 11 and 8 are the other still supported (long-term support − LTS) versions, where Oracle Customers will receive Oracle Premier Support. Oracle continues to release no-cost public Java 8 updates for development and personal use indefinitely.
In the case of OpenJDK, both commercial long-term support and free software updates are available from multiple organizations in the broader community.
Java 25 was released on 16 September 2025.


== Release table ==


== JDK 1.0 ==

The first version was released on January 23, 1996. The first stable version, JDK 1.0.2, is called Java 1.

It included:

core language features (basic java types in java.lang, and utility classes in java.util)
support for graphics (AWT framework)
support for creating a Java applet
libraries for I/O and networking


== JDK 1.1 ==

Major additions in the release on February 19, 1997 included:

extensive retooling of the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) event model
inner classes added to the language
JavaBeans
Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) and support for sql
Java remote method invocation (RMI) and serialization
reflection which supported Introspection only, no modification at runtime was possible. (The ability to modify objects reflectively was added in J2SE 1.2, by introducing the AccessibleObject class and its subclasses such as the Field class.)
Just-in-time compilation (JIT) on Microsoft Windows platforms, produced for JavaSoft by Symantec
Internationalization and Unicode support originating from Taligent


== J2SE 1.2 ==

The release on December 8, 1998 and subsequent releases through J2SE 5.0 were rebranded retrospectively Java 2 and the version name "J2SE" (Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition) replaced JDK to distinguish the base platform from J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition) and J2ME (Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition). This was a very significant release of Java as it tripled the size of the Java platform to 1520 classes in 59 packages. Major additions included:

strictfp keyword (by JVM 17 an obsolete keyword, should not be used in new code)
The Swing graphical API was integrated into the core classes.
Sun's JVM was equipped with a JIT compiler for the first time.
Java plug-in
Java IDL, an IDL implementation for CORBA interoperability
Collections framework


== J2SE 1.3 ==

The most notable changes in the May 8, 2000 release were:

HotSpot JVM included (the HotSpot JVM was first released in April 1999 for the J2SE 1.2 JVM)
RMI was modified to support optional compatibility with CORBA.
Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) included in core libraries (previously available as an extension)
Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA)
JavaSound
Synthetic proxy classes
Java 1.3 is the last release of Java to officially support Microsoft Windows 95.


== J2SE 1.4 ==

The February 6, 2002 release was the first release of the Java platform developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 59. Major changes included:

Language changes
assert keyword (specified in JSR 41)
Library improvements
Regular expressions modeled after Perl regular expressions
Exception chaining allows an exception to encapsulate original lower-level exception
Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) support
Non-blocking I/O (named NIO) (specified in JSR 51)
Logging API (specified in JSR 47)
Image I/O API for reading and writing images in formats like JPEG and PNG
Integrated XML parser and XSLT processor (JAXP) (specified in JSR 5 and JSR 63)
Integrated security and cryptography extensions (JCE, JSSE, JAAS)
Java Web Start included (Java Web Start was first released in March 2001 for J2SE 1.3) (specified in JSR 56)
Preferences API (java.util.prefs)
Public support and security updates for Java 1.4 ended in October 2008. Paid security updates for Oracle customers ended in February 2013.


== Java SE 5 ==

The release on September 30, 2004 was originally numbered 1.5, which is still used as the internal version number. The number was changed to "better reflect the level of maturity, stability, scalability and security of the J2SE". This version was developed under JSR 176.
Java SE 5 entered its end-of-public-updates period on April 8, 2008; updates are no longer available to the public as of November 3, 2009. Updates were available to paid Oracle customers until May 2015.
Tiger added a number of significant new language features:

Generics: provides compile-time (static) type safety for collections and eliminates the need for most typecasts (type conversion) (specified by JSR 14)
Metadata: also called annotations; allows language constructs such as classes and methods to be tagged with additional data, which can then be processed by metadata-aware utilities (specified by JSR 175)
Autoboxing/unboxing: automatic conversions between primitive types (such as int) and primitive wrapper classes (such as Integer) (specified by JSR 201)
Enumerations: the enum keyword creates a typesafe, ordered list of values (such as Day.MONDAY, Day.TUESDAY, etc.); previously this could only be achieved by non-typesafe constant integers or manually constructed classes (typesafe enum pattern) (specified by JSR 201)
Varargs: the last parameter of a method can now be declared using a type name followed by three dots (e.g. void drawtext(String... lines)); in the calling code any number of parameters of that type can be used and they are then placed in an array to be passed to the method, or alternatively the calling code can pass an array of that type
Enhanced for each loop: the for loop syntax is extended with special syntax for iterating over each member of either an array or any Iterable, such as the standard Collection classes (specified by JSR 201)
Improved semantics of execution for multi-threaded Java programs; the new Java memory model addresses issues of complexity, effectiveness, and performance of previous specifications
Static imports
There were also the following improvements to the standard libraries:

Automatic stub generation for RMI objects
Swing: New skinnable look and feel, called synth
The concurrency utilities in package java.util.concurrent
Scanner class for parsing data from various input streams and buffers
Java 5 is the last release of Java to officially support Microsoft Windows 98 and Windows ME, while Windows Vista was the newest version of Windows that Java SE 5 was supported on prior to Java 5 going end-of-life in October 2009.
Java 5 Update 5 (1.5.0_05) is the last release of Java to work on Windows 95 (with Internet Explorer 5.5 installed) and Windows NT 4.0.
Java 5 was first available on Apple Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and was the default version of Java installed on Apple Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard).
Public support and security updates for Java 1.5 ended in November 2009. Paid security updates for Oracle customers ended in April 2015.


=== Versioning change ===
This version introduced a new versioning system for the Java language, although the old versioning system continued to be used for developer libraries:

Both version numbers "1.5.0" and "5.0" are used to identify this release of the Java 2 Platform Standard Edition. Version "5.0" is the product version, while "1.5.0" is the developer version. The number "5.0" is used to better reflect the level of maturity, stability, scalability and security of the J2SE.
This correspondence continued through later releases (Java 6 = JDK 1.6, Java 7 = JDK 1.7, and so on).


== Java SE 6 ==

As of the version released on December 11, 2006, Sun replaced the name "J2SE" with Java SE and dropped the ".0" from the version number. Internal numbering for developers remains 1.6.0.
This version was developed under JSR 270.
During the development phase, new builds including enhancements and bug fixes were released approximately weekly. Beta versions were released in February and June 2006, leading up to a final release that occurred on December 11, 2006.
Major changes included in this version:

Support for older Win9x versions dropped; unofficially, Java 6 Update 7 was the last release of Java shown to work on these versions of Windows. This is believed to be due to the major changes in Update 10.
Scripting Language Support (JSR 223): Generic API for tight integration with scripting languages, and built-in Mozilla JavaScript Rhino integration.
Dramatic performance improvements for the core platform, and Swing.
Improved Web Service support through JAX-WS (JSR 224).
JDBC 4.0 support (JSR 221).
Java Compiler API (JSR 199): an API allowing a Java program to select and invoke a Java Compiler programmatically.
Upgrade of JAXB to version 2.0: Including integration of a StAX parser.
Support for pluggable annotations (JSR 269).
Many GUI improvements, such as integration of SwingWorker in the API, table sorting and filtering, and true Swing double-buffering (eliminating the gray-area effect).
JVM improvements include: synchronization and compiler performance optimizations, new algorithms and upgrades to existing garbage collection algorithms, and application start-up performance.
Java 6 can be installed to Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) running on 64-bit (Core 2 Duo and higher) processor machines. Java 6 is also supported by both 32-bit and 64-bit machines running Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard).
Java 6 reached the end of its supported life in February 2013, at which time all public updates, including security updates, were scheduled to be stopped. Oracle released two more updates to Java 6 in March and April 2013, which patched some security vulnerabilities.


=== Java 6 updates ===
After Java 6 release, Sun, and later Oracle, released several updates which, while not changing any public API, enhanced end-user usability or fixed bugs.


== Java SE 7 ==

Java 7 was a major update that launched on July 7, 2011 and was made available for developers on July 28, 2011. The development period was organized into thirteen milestones; on June 6, 2011, the last of the thirteen milestones was finished. On average, 8 builds (which generally included enhancements and bug fixes) were released per milestone. The feature list at the OpenJDK 7 project lists many of the changes.
Additions in Java 7 include:

JVM support for dynamic languages, with the new invokedynamic bytecode under JSR-292, following the prototyping work currently done on the Multi Language Virtual Machine
Compressed 64-bit pointers (available in Java 6 with -XX:+UseCompressedOops)
Project Coin language features:
Strings in switch
Automatic resource management in try-statement aka try-with-resources statement
Improved type inference for generic instance creation, aka the diamond operator <>
Simplified varargs method declaration
Binary integer literals
Allowing underscores in numeric literals
Catching multiple exception types and rethrowing exceptions with improved type checking
Concurrency utilities under JSR 166
New file I/O library (defined by JSR 203) adding support for multiple file systems, file metadata and symbolic links. The new packages are java.nio.file, java.nio.file.attribute and java.nio.file.spi
Timsort is used to sort collections and arrays of objects instead of merge sort
Library-level support for elliptic curve cryptography algorithms
An XRender pipeline for Java 2D, which improves handling of features specific to modern GPUs
New platform APIs for the graphics features originally implemented in version 6u10 as unsupported APIs
Enhanced library-level support for new network protocols, including SCTP and Sockets Direct Protocol
Upstream updates to XML and Unicode
Java deployment rule sets
Lambda (Java's implementation of lambda functions), Jigsaw (Java's implementation of modules), and part of Coin were dropped from Java 7, and released as part of Java 8 (except for Jigsaw, which was released in Java 9).
Java 7 was the default version to download on java.com from April 2012 until Java 8 was released.


=== Java 7 updates ===
Oracle issued public updates to the Java 7 family on a quarterly basis until April 2015 when the product reached the end of its public availability. Further updates for JDK 7, which continued until July 2022, are only made available to customers with a support contract.


== Java SE 8 (LTS) ==

Java 8 was released on 18 March 2014, and included some features that were planned for Java 7 but later deferred.
Work on features was organized in terms of JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs).

JSR 335, JEP 126: Language-level support for lambda expressions (officially, lambda expressions; unofficially, closures) under Project Lambda and default methods (virtual extension methods) which can be used to add methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations. There was an ongoing debate in the Java community on whether to add support for lambda expressions. Sun later declared that lambda expressions would be included in Java and asked for community input to refine the feature. Supporting lambda expressions also enables functional-style operations on streams of elements, such as MapReduce-inspired transformations on collections. Default methods can be used by an author of an API to add new methods to an interface without breaking the old code using it. Although it was not their primary intent, default methods can also be used for multiple inheritance of behavior (but not state).
JEP 174: Project Nashorn, a JavaScript runtime which can run JavaScript code embedded within applications
JEP 104: Annotation on Java types
Unsigned integer arithmetic
JEP 120: Repeating annotations
JEP 150: Date and time API
JEP 178: Statically-linked JNI libraries
JEP 153: Launch JavaFX applications (direct launching of JavaFX application JARs)
JEP 122: Remove the permanent generation
Java 8 is not supported on Windows XP but as of JDK 8 update 25, it can still be installed and run under Windows XP. Previous updates of JDK 8 could be run under XP by downloading archived zip format file and unzipping it for the executable. The last version of Java 8 could run on XP is update 251.
From October 2014, Java 8 was the default version to download (and then again the download replacing Java 9) from the official website. "Oracle will continue to provide Public Updates and auto updates of Java SE 8, Indefinitely for Personal Users".


=== Java 8 updates ===


== Java SE 9 ==

Java SE 9 was made available on September 21, 2017 due to controversial acceptance of the current implementation of Project Jigsaw by Java Executive Committee which led Oracle to fix some open issues and concerns and to refine some critical technical questions. In the last days of June 2017, Java Community Process expressed nearly unanimous consensus on the proposed Module System scheme.

JSR 376: Modularization of the JDK under Project Jigsaw (Java Platform Module System)
JavaDB was removed from JDK
JEP 193: Variable handles, define a standard means to invoke the equivalents of various java.util.concurrent.atomic and sun.misc.Unsafe operations

JEP 222: jshell: The Java Shell (Read-Eval-Print Loop): JShell is a REPL command-line interface for the Java language.
JEP 254: Compact Strings
JEP 263: HiDPI graphics: automatic scaling and sizing
JEP 266: More concurrency updates, it includes a Java implementation of Reactive Streams, including a new Flow class that included the interfaces previously provided by Reactive Streams
JEP 268: XML catalogs
JEP 282: jlink: The Java Linker, create a tool that can assemble and optimize a set of modules and their dependencies into a custom run-time image. It effectively allows to produce a fully usable executable including the JVM to run it
JEP 295: Ahead-of-Time Compilation, ahead-of-time compilation provided by GraalVM
The first Java 9 release candidate was released on August 9, 2017. The first stable release of Java 9 was on September 21, 2017.


=== History ===
At JavaOne 2011, Oracle discussed features they hoped to release for Java 9 in 2016. Java 9 should include better support for multi-gigabyte heaps, better native code integration, a different default garbage collector (G1, for "shorter response times") and a self-tuning JVM. In early 2016, the release of Java 9 was rescheduled for March 2017 and later again postponed four more months to July 2017.


=== Java 9 updates ===


== Java SE 10 ==

OpenJDK 10 was released on March 20, 2018, with twelve new features confirmed. Among these features were:

JEP 286: Local-Variable Type Inference

=== Java 14 updates ===


== Java SE 15 ==

JDK 15 was released on September 15, 2020. Java 15 adds e.g. support for multi-line string literals (aka Text Blocks). The Shenandoah and Z garbage collectors (latter sometimes abbreviated ZGC) are now ready for use in production (i.e. no longer marked experimental). Support for Oracle's Solaris operating system (and SPARC CPUs) is dropped (while still available in e.g. Java 11). The Nashorn JavaScript Engine is removed. Also removed some root CA certificates.

Together with records, sealed classes are sum types. They work well with other recent features like records, switch expressions, and pattern matching for instance-of. They all form part of a system for "Pattern matching in Java" first discussed by Gavin Bierman and Brian Goetz, in September 2018.


=== Java 15 updates ===


== Java SE 16 ==

JDK 16 was released on March 16, 2021. Java 16 removes Ahead-of-Time compilation (and Graal JIT) options. The Java implementation itself was and is still written in C++, while as of Java 16, more recent C++14 (but still not e.g. C++17 or C++20) is allowed. The code was also moved to GitHub, dropping Mercurial as the source control system.

== Future features ==
Project Valhalla: Value classes, whose objects lack identity, but can in certain cases get an improved memory layout (with less indirection), or have their allocation optimized away entirely.
Project Panama:
Improved interoperability with native code, to enable Java source code to call functions and use data types from other languages, in a way that is easier and has better performance than today (this part of Project Panama is getting stabilized in Java 22 under JEP 454: Foreign Function & Memory API).
Vector API, a portable and relatively low-level abstraction layer for SIMD programming. Its stabilization is dependent on Project Valhalla.
Project Lilliput: Reduce the size of Java object headers. First down to 64 bits, and then down to 32 bits.
Reducing startup time and warm-up time (time to peak performance) in JIT mode:
Project CRaC enables making snapshots of whole JVM (together with the running application) and restoring it with necessary adjustments (reopening files, sockets, etc).
Project Leyden, among other things, will allow partial or (in the long term) full AOT compiling, reducing overall dynamism (by adopting so called "closed-world constraints") to reduce dynamic compiling overhead.
Project Babylon aims to extend the Java language's reach to alternative programming models with an enhancement to its reflective programming abilities, called code reflection (i.e., reflection over code itself). The stated main goal is to run Java code on GPUs, with SQL and other programming models as secondary targets.


== Implementations ==
The officially supported Java platform, first developed at Sun and now stewarded by Oracle, is Java SE. Releases are based on the OpenJDK project, a free and open-source project with an open development model. Other Java implementations exist, however—in part due to Java's early history as proprietary software. In contrast, some implementations were created to offer some benefits over the standard implementation, often the result of some area of academic or corporate-sponsored research. Many Linux distributions include builds of OpenJDK through the IcedTea project started by Red Hat, which provides a more straightforward build and integration environment.
Visual J++ and the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine were created as incompatible implementations. After the Sun v. Microsoft lawsuit, Microsoft abandoned it and began work on the .NET platform. In 2021, Microsoft started distributing compatible "Microsoft Build of OpenJDK" for Java 11 first then also for Java 17. Their builds support not only Windows, but also Linux and macOS.
Other proprietary Java implementations are available, such as Azul's Zing. Azul offers certified open source OpenJDK builds under the Zulu moniker.
Prior to the release of OpenJDK, while Sun's implementation was still proprietary, the GNU Classpath project was created to provide a free and open-source implementation of the Java platform. Since the release of JDK 7, when OpenJDK became the official reference implementation, the original motivation for the GNU Classpath project almost completely disappeared, and its last release was in 2012.
The Apache Harmony project was started shortly before the release of OpenJDK. After Sun's initial source code release, the Harmony project continued, working to provide an implementation under a lax license, in contrast to the protective license chosen for OpenJDK. Google later developed Android and released it under a lax license. Android incorporated parts of the Harmony project, supplemented with Google's own Dalvik virtual machine and ART. Apache Harmony has since been retired, and Google has switched its Harmony components with equivalent ones from OpenJDK.
Both Jikes and Jikes RVM are open-source research projects that IBM developed.
Several other implementations exist that started as proprietary software, but are now open source. IBM initially developed OpenJ9 as the proprietary J9, but has since relicensed the project and donated it to the Eclipse Foundation. JRockit is a proprietary implementation that was acquired by Oracle and incorporated into subsequent OpenJDK versions.


=== Most commonly used implementations in 2025 ===
Amazon developed Corretto, a no-cost, multiplatform, production-ready distribution of OpenJDK with long-term support that includes performance enhancements and security fixes. Corretto is certified as compatible with the Java SE standard and is used internally at Amazon for many production services.
The Eclipse Temurin project, formerly known as AdoptOpenJDK, provides prebuilt OpenJDK binaries from a fully open source build farm. The project transitioned to the Eclipse Foundation in 2021 as part of the Adoptium Working Group, which ensures high-quality, vendor-neutral Java runtime distributions.
BellSoft Liberica JDK is another OpenJDK-based implementation that provides builds for a wide range of platforms, including support for embedded systems and older architectures. It offers both standard and "Full" versions that include additional components like JavaFX.
SAP Machine is SAP's downstream distribution of OpenJDK, optimized for SAP applications and deployments. It provides both short-term and long-term support releases aligned with OpenJDK's release schedule.
Alibaba Dragonwell is a downstream version of OpenJDK with some in-house optimizations. It includes enhancements in startup performance, footprint, and throughput.
GraalVM represents a significant departure from traditional Java implementations. Developed by Oracle Labs, it provides a polyglot virtual machine supporting multiple languages beyond Java, including JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and R. GraalVM includes an advanced just-in-time compiler written in Java and supports ahead-of-time compilation for creating native executables, substantially reducing startup time and memory footprint.
Red Hat build of OpenJDK is Red Hat's supported distribution of OpenJDK for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Windows, providing long-term support and regular updates as part of Red Hat's subscription offerings.
The Semeru Runtime, based on the Eclipse OpenJ9 JVM and OpenJDK class libraries, is IBM's no-cost Java runtime optimized for cloud deployments. It offers improved startup time, smaller memory footprint, and better throughput compared to HotSpot-based implementations.
